<h1><font color="red"> To My Love of Life Swarnali</font> </h1>
<h2>The moment that I first met you,</h2>
<h2>I knew with absolute certainty and clarity that we were meant to be.</h2>
<h2>I wasn't being presumptuous when I thought so,</h2> 
<h2>for there was this voice within my soul that just validated this thought.</h2> 
<h2>This voice found validation the day you asked me out and I,</h2>
<h2>with absolute confidence in that voice, said yes to you.</h2>
<h2>Since that very day till today, </h2>
<h2>I haven't regretted a moment in your company and that is how I know that I am lucky to have found you.</h2>
<h2>You are my every dream come true</h2>
<h2> Second command.............. </h2>
